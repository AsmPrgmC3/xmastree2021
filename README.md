Code and coordinates for Matt's 2021 xmas tree

This repository contains the code and coordinates used for Matt's 2021 Christmas tree, as featured in ["My 500-LED xmas tree got into Harvard."](https://youtu.be/WuMRJf6B5Q4).

`light_fixer.py` is the original source code from the video. Code in the `examples` folder has been provided by other contributors!

Most of what you need is probably over on the Harvard Graduate School of Design repository: ["GSD-6338: Introduction to Computational Design"](https://github.com/GSD6338)

## Contributing

You're welcome to contribute! There are a few different places that your PR could target:

- Small bug fixes, as well as small changes that significantly increase usability, will be accepted directly in to the original code.

- The `examples` folder has been created as a place for any effects contained within a single CSV file. Files should be named based on the effect - `fire.csv` for example.

- If you've done a bigger bit of work, consider keeping this in your own repository, and opening a PR to update the Further Work section below.
